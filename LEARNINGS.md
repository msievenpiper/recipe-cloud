# LEARNINGS

When engaging in this project, the initial approach was using Gemini Code Assist in JetBrains. This was a interesting experience but essentially works the same as a regular chat bot with limited project context support. It is not a true code assistant in the way Cursor or Antigravity is. So during this experimental project the inital approach was limited and not as effective as I had hoped.
